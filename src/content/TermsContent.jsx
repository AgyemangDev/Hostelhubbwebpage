            <li>
              <strong>Platform Facilitation Only:</strong>HostelHubb serves
              solely as an online platform to connect users with hostels. By
              using the HostelHubb App, users acknowledge that HostelHubb is not
              a party to any agreement between the user and the hostel.
              HostelHubb provides an interface for browsing, booking, and paying
              for accommodations, but does not own, operate, or manage any
              hostels listed on the platform. The responsibility for the actual
              booking and transaction lies entirely with the hostel management,
              not with HostelHubb.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Booking Confirmation and Payment:</strong> Users agree to
              pay for their bookings in full at the time of reservation or as
              per the payment terms set by the hostel. All bookings are subject
              to the availability of the accommodation and final confirmation
              from the hostel. HostelHubb does not guarantee the availability or
              suitability of any hostel and will not be held liable if a booking
              cannot be fulfilled. Users are advised to confirm their bookings
              directly with the hostel for further assurance.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Refund and Cancellation Policies:</strong> HostelHubb does
              not manage, process, or enforce refund or cancellation policies
              for any bookings made through the platform. Each hostel is
              responsible for establishing and communicating its own policies on
              refunds, cancellations, or rebookings. Any disputes, claims, or
              concerns regarding refunds or cancellations should be addressed
              directly with the hostel. HostelHubb disclaims any liability in
              situations where the hostel is unable or unwilling to offer a
              refund, as we merely facilitate the booking on behalf of the user.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Disputes and Resolution:</strong> In the event of any
              dispute or issue related to a booking, the user must resolve these
              matters directly with the hostel management.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Exclusion of Liability:</strong> HostelHubb disclaims all
              liability for any outcomes arising from bookings made through the
              platform. By using the HostelHubb App, users acknowledge that they
              assume full responsibility for their booking choices, including
              the suitability, quality, and availability of the selected
              accommodation. HostelHubb shall not be held accountable for any
              direct, indirect, incidental, or consequential losses, damages, or
              claims arising from or related to bookings, payments,
              cancellations, or refunds. This exclusion of liability applies to
              any legal jurisdiction in which HostelHubb operates, in alignment
              with Ghanaian law.

            <li>
              <strong>Platform Role:</strong> HostelHubb serves as a digital
              platform designed to facilitate the hostel booking process,
              offering users the convenience of browsing available
              accommodations and booking their stay directly through the app.
              However, HostelHubb does not directly manage, own, or operate any
              hostel listed on the platform. We merely act as an intermediary to
              connect users with accommodation providers.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Information Accuracy:</strong> HostelHubb strives to
              provide accurate, complete, and up-to-date information regarding
              hostel listings, amenities, pricing, and availability. Despite our
              efforts, we cannot guarantee the absolute accuracy or completeness
              of all content displayed on the platform, as this information is
              provided by the hostels. Users are advised to verify essential
              details with the hostel management directly prior to booking.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Content Variability:</strong> The content, features, and
              design of the HostelHubb platform may vary depending on user
              location, preferences, and platform updates. We may periodically
              introduce new features, modify existing ones, or customize the
              user experience based on various factors, including device type
              and regional settings, to improve overall service and user
              satisfaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>No Endorsement:</strong> HostelHubb does not endorse,
              recommend, or guarantee any specific hostel or accommodation
              listed on the platform. All accommodation providers listed are
              independent entities, and users are encouraged to exercise
              discretion and make informed decisions based on personal research
              and reviews.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Contractual Relationship:</strong> When you book a hostel
              through the HostelHubb platform, your contractual relationship
              exists solely between you (the user) and the hostel management.
              HostelHubb is not a party to any agreement or contract between the
              user and the accommodation provider. Therefore, any issues or
              disputes arising from your booking must be resolved directly with
              the hostel.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Platform Availability:</strong> HostelHubb aims to offer a
              consistent, uninterrupted booking experience, available 24/7.
              However, the platform may occasionally experience downtime for
              scheduled maintenance, updates, or unforeseen technical issues.
              During these times, some services may be temporarily unavailable,
              and we appreciate your understanding as we work to restore full
              functionality promptly.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Limitation of Responsibility:</strong> While HostelHubb
              aims to ensure a safe and reliable platform for hostel bookings,
              we shall not be held liable for any incidents, losses, or damages
              resulting from transactions, interactions, or contracts made
              between users and hostels. The user acknowledges that HostelHubb's
              role is limited to facilitating connections, and assumes full
              responsibility for their engagement with listed hostels.

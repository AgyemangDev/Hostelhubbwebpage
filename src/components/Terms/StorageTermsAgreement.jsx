          <li>All bookings must be made through the Hostelhubb Mobile Application.</li>
          <li>Storage fees must be paid in full to confirm your booking.</li>

        </ul>
      </section>

      <section style={styles.section}>
        <h2>3. Pickup and Delivery Procedures</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>First Semester:</strong> Door-to-door pickup in university halls.</li>
          <li><strong>Second Semester:</strong> Drop-off at designated locations selected by the student.</li>
          <li>Students must be present at the drop-off point or authorize someone to collect items on their behalf.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section style={styles.section}>
        <h2>4. Late Pickup Fees</h2>
        <p>
          If a student fails to collect their stored items on the designated delivery day, <strong>late pickup fees</strong> will apply as follows:
        </p>
        <h3>Fee Calculation</h3>
        <p>
          <strong>Daily Penalty Formula:</strong><br />
          <code>Late Fee = 0.5 Ã— (Storage Fee) Ã— (Number of Days Late)</code>
        </p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>
          If your storage fee is GHâ‚µ100 and you are 3 days late:<br />
          <code>0.5 Ã— 100 Ã— 3 = GHâ‚µ150</code><br />
          So, the total late fee would be <strong>GHâ‚µ150</strong>.
        </p>
        <h3>Important Details</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>The late fee is <strong>charged per day</strong> after the scheduled delivery date.</li>
          <li>Hostelhubb may <strong>withhold delivery</strong> of your items until all late fees are paid in full.</li>
          <li>The calculation is based on <strong>half the original storage fee</strong> multiplied by the number of days late.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Policy Reminders</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Students are encouraged to pick up their items on the scheduled date to avoid additional charges.</li>
          <li>If items are not collected within <strong>14 days</strong> after the delivery date, they may be considered abandoned and subject to forfeiture.</li>
        </ul>
